This is a productivity timer inspired by a [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

By default there is a classical pomodoro time of 25 minutes and break of 5 minutes. After first two hours break of 10 minutes, and after 4 hours break of 30 minutes (these settings can be changed in `config.hjson`).

This timer differs from similar others by fully automation and locking a screen when a break. So you don't need manually click start or regulate a time.

It also have automatically adjustment for timers when you AFK for a while.

In additional it contains a feature to add separate single timers. 

For example someone ask you to do something exactly after a hour, or you need remember to turn off eggs after 10 minutes. 
You will always see when a timer is elapsed, so you can't miss important things anymore.
