![DotBadge](http://rebornix.qiniudn.com/dotbadge.svg) [![Github Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/HarpyWar/chronofag-timer/total.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://github.com/HarpyWar/chronofag-timer/releases)

This is a productivity timer inspired by a [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

By default there is a classical pomodoro time of 25 minutes and break of 5 minutes. After first 4 pomodoros there is a break of 15 minutes and after 8 pomodoros &mdash; a break of 30 minutes (these settings can be changed in `config.hjson`).

This timer differs from similar others by fully automation and locking a screen when a break. So you don't need manually click start or regulate a time 

*You can enable lock mode by setting up `lockkeyboard = true` in [config.hjson](https://github.com/HarpyWar/chronofag-timer/blob/master/ChronoFagTimer/config.hjson#L128). After that you will not able to close the program (only kill a process in task manager).*

It also have automatically adjustment for timers when you AFK for a while.

In additional it contains a feature to add separate single timers. 

For example someone ask you to do something exactly after a hour, or you need remember to turn off eggs after 10 minutes. 
You will always see when a timer is elapsed, so you can't miss important things anymore.
